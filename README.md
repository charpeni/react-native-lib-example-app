# React Native Lib Example App

This repository is used to demonstrate how we can create an example app for a React Native library using ðŸš‡ [Metro bundler](https://facebook.github.io/metro/).

- **Easy** to link your library within your example app.
- No need to **sync** your library on each change.
- No need of **symlinks** (which are not followed by Metro).
- No need to hassle with duplicated **haste modules**.
